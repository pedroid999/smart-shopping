# AI-Powered E-commerce Shopping Assistant Implementation

This document provides an overview of the implementation of the AI-powered e-commerce shopping assistant MVP.

## Architecture Overview

The system consists of two main components:

1. **Backend (Python/FastAPI)**
   - RESTful API endpoints for chat, product search, cart management, and checkout
   - AI agent using LangGraph for natural language understanding and product recommendations
   - Services for product data, cart management, and payment processing

2. **Frontend (Next.js)**
   - Modern, responsive UI built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS
   - Chat interface for conversational shopping
   - Product display and cart management
   - Checkout integration

## Backend Components

### FastAPI Application (`backend/main.py`)
- Defines API endpoints for chat, search, product details, cart operations, and checkout
- Handles WebSocket connections for real-time chat
- Manages session state and agent instances

### Data Models
- Request models (`backend/app/models/request_models.py`): Define the structure of API requests
- Response models (`backend/app/models/response_models.py`): Define the structure of API responses

### Services
- Product Service (`backend/app/services/product_service.py`): Handles product search and retrieval
- Cart Service (`backend/app/services/cart_service.py`): Manages shopping cart operations
- Payment Service (`backend/app/services/payment_service.py`): Integrates with Stripe for payment processing

### AI Agent
- Shopping Agent (`backend/app/agent/shopping_agent.py`): LangGraph-powered agent for understanding user queries and recommending products
- Uses OpenAI's API for natural language understanding
- Implements a graph-based workflow for reasoning and tool usage

## Frontend Components

### Pages
- Home Page (`frontend/app/page.tsx`): Landing page with links to chat and about pages
- Chat Page (`frontend/app/chat/page.tsx`): Main interface for conversational shopping
- About Page (`frontend/app/about/page.tsx`): Information about the application

### API Service
- Service module (`frontend/app/api/service.ts`): Handles communication with the backend API

## How It Works

1. User enters a natural language query like "Find me a budget gaming laptop"
2. The frontend sends this query to the backend API
3. The AI agent processes the query using LangGraph:
   - Understands the intent (searching for a laptop)
   - Extracts constraints (budget, gaming)
   - Uses tools to search the product catalog
   - Formulates a response with recommendations
4. The frontend displays the response and any recommended products
5. User can continue the conversation, view product details, add to cart, etc.
6. For checkout, the system integrates with Stripe for secure payment processing

## Running the Application

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to use the application.

## Next Steps

This MVP implementation provides the core functionality for conversational shopping. Future enhancements could include:

- Voice input/output capabilities
- Multi-modal interactions (e.g., image upload for visual search)
- Personalized recommendations based on user history
- Integration with more payment providers
- Advanced analytics and insights
- Multi-language support
